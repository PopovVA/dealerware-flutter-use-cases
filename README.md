# Dealerware Flutter Use Cases

A Flutter demo project showcasing **REST**, **GraphQL**, and **WebSocket** integrations with CI/CD pipelines.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This repository demonstrates how to build a scalable Flutter mobile application that integrates different data APIs (REST + GraphQL) and supports real-time communication via WebSockets.  
It also includes three CI/CD configurations:

- **GitHub Actions**
- **Codemagic**

The goal is to simulate realistic Dealerware-style use cases, focusing on fast iteration, strong architecture, and reliable delivery pipelines.

## ðŸ§© Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (Android & iOS)
- **Riverpod** for state management
- **Dio** for REST API
- **GraphQL Flutter** for queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates
- **Fastlane / GitHub Actions / Codemagic** for CI/CD automation

## ðŸ›  Getting Started
